/**
 * Working copy administrative database layer.
 *
 * The design doc mentions three different kinds of trees, BASE, WORKING and
 * ACTUAL. We have different APIs to handle each tree, enumerated below, along
 * with a blurb to explain what that tree represents.
 *
 * <p>
 * Has those next categories of routines:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li><b>General administractive functions</b></li>
 *
 * <li>(*Base*") <b> BASE tree management</b>
 * <p>
 * BASE should be what we get from the server. The *absolute* pristine copy.
 * Nothing can change it -- it is always a reflection of the repository. You
 * need to use checkout, update, switch, or commit to alter your view of the
 * repository.</li>
 * <li>(*Pristine*) <b> Pristine ("text base") management </b></li>
 * <li>(*Repository) <b> Repository information management </b></li>
 *
 * <li>(op*) <b> Operations on WORKING tree</b></li>
 *
 * <li>(read*) <b> Read operations on the BASE/WORKING tree</b>
 * <p>
 * These functions query information about nodes in ACTUAL, and returns the
 * requested information from the appropriate ACTUAL, WORKING, or BASE tree.
 * <p>
 * For example, asking for the checksum of the pristine version will return the
 * one recorded in WORKING, or if no WORKING node exists, then the checksum
 * comes from BASE.</li>
 *
 * <li>(global*) <b> Operations that alter multiple trees</b></li>
 *
 * <li>(*Lock) <b> Function to manage the LOCKS table. </b></li>
 *
 * <li>(scan*) <b> Functions to scan up a tree for further data </b></li>
 *
 * <li>(*WorkQueue) <b> Work queue manipulation </b></li>
 *
 * </ul>

     * Scan upwards for additional information about a deleted node.
     * <p>
     * When a deleted node is discovered in the WORKING tree, the situation may
     * be quite complex. This function will provide the information to resolve
     * the circumstances of the deletion.
     * <p>
     *
     * For discussion purposes, we will start with the most complex example and
     * then demonstrate simplified examples. Consider node B/W/D/N has been
     * found as deleted. B is an unmodified directory (thus, only in BASE). W is
     * "replacement" content that exists in WORKING, shadowing a similar B/W
     * directory in BASE. D is a deleted subtree in the WORKING tree, and N is
     * the deleted node.
     * <p>
     *
     * In this example, BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will bet set to B/W. That is the root
     * of the BASE tree (implicitly) deleted by the replacement. BASE_REPLACED
     * will be set to TRUE since B/W replaces the BASE node at B/W.
     * WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will be set to the subtree deleted within the
     * replacement; in this case, B/W/D. No move-away took place, so
     * MOVED_TO_ABSPATH is set to NULL.
     * <p>
     *
     * In another scenario, B/W was moved-away before W was put into the WORKING
     * tree through an add/copy/move-here. MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will indicate where
     * B/W was moved to. Note that further operations may have been performed
     * post-move, but that is not known or reported by this function.
     * <p>
     *
     * If BASE does not have a B/W, then the WORKING B/W is not a replacement,
     * but a simple add/copy/move-here. BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will be set to NULL,
     * and BASE_REPLACED will be set to FALSE.
     * <p>
     *
     * If B/W/D does not exist in the WORKING tree (we're only talking about a
     * deletion of nodes of the BASE tree), then deleting B/W/D would have
     * marked the subtree for deletion. BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will refer to B/W/D,
     * BASE_REPLACED will be FALSE, MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will be NULL, and
     * WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will be NULL.
     * <p>
     *
     * If the BASE node B/W/D was moved instead of deleted, then
     * MOVED_TO_ABSPATH would indicate the target location (and other OUT values
     * as above).
     * <p>
     *
     * When the user deletes B/W/D from the WORKING tree, there are a few
     * additional considerations. If B/W is a simple addition (not a copy or a
     * move-here), then the deletion will simply remove the nodes from WORKING
     * and possibly leave behind "base-delete" markers in the WORKING tree. If
     * the source is a copy/moved-here, then the nodes are replaced with
     * deletion markers.
     * <p>
     *
     * If the user moves-away B/W/D from the WORKING tree, then behavior is
     * again dependent upon the origination of B/W. For a plain add, the nodes
     * simply move to the destination. For a copy, a deletion is made at B/W/D,
     * and a new copy (of a subtree of the original source) is made at the
     * destination. For a move-here, a deletion is made, and a copy is made at
     * the destination (we do not track multiple moves; the source is moved to
     * B/W, then B/W/D is deleted; then a copy is made at the destination;
     * however, note the double-move could have been performed by moving the
     * subtree first, then moving the source to B/W).
     * <p>
     *
     * There are three further considerations when resolving a deleted node:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>
     * If the BASE B/W/D was moved-away, then BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will specify
     * B/W/D as the root of the BASE deletion (not necessarily B/W as an
     * implicit delete caused by a replacement; only the closest ancestor is
     * reported). The other parameters will operate as normal, based on what is
     * happening in the WORKING tree. Also note that ancestors of B/W/D may
     * report additional, explicit moved-away status.
     *
     * <li>
     * If the BASE B/W/D was deleted explicitly *and* B/W is a replacement, then
     * the explicit deletion is subsumed by the implicit deletion that occurred
     * with the B/W replacement. Thus, BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will point to B/W as the
     * root of the BASE deletion. IOW, we can detect the explicit move-away, but
     * not an explicit deletion.
     *
     * <li>
     * If B/W/D/N refers to a node present in the BASE tree, and B/W was
     * replaced by a shallow subtree, then it is possible for N to be reported
     * as deleted (from BASE) yet no deletions occurred in the WORKING tree
     * above N. Thus, WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will be set to NULL.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * Summary of OUT parameters:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>
     * BASE_DEL_ABSPATH will specify the nearest ancestor of the explicit or
     * implicit deletion (if any) that applies to the BASE tree.
     *
     * <li>
     * BASE_REPLACED will specify whether the node at BASE_DEL_ABSPATH has been
     * replaced (shadowed) by nodes in the WORKING tree. If no BASE deletion has
     * occurred (BASE_DEL_ABSPATH is NULL, meaning the deletion is confined to
     * the WORKING TREE), then BASE_REPLACED will be FALSE.
     *
     * <li>
     * MOVED_TO_ABSPATH will specify the nearest ancestor that has moved-away,
     * if any. If no ancestors have been moved-away, then this is set to NULL.
     *
     * <li>
     * WORK_DEL_ABSPATH will specify the root of a deleted subtree within the
     * WORKING tree (note there is no concept of layered delete operations in
     * WORKING, so there is only one deletion root in the ancestry).
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     *
     * All OUT parameters may be set to NULL to indicate a lack of interest in
     * that piece of information.
     *
     * <p>
     * If the node given by LOCAL_ABSPATH does not exist, then
     * {@link SVNErrorCode#WC_PATH_NOT_FOUND} is returned. If it doesn't have a
     * "deleted" status, then {@link SVNErrorCode#WC_PATH_UNEXPECTED_STATUS}

<B><SPAN CLASS="javasvn">JavaSVN</SPAN><SUP>TM</SUP></B> - the only pure Java<SUP>TM</SUP> Subversion client library in the World.

<BR>
<!--<img src="JavaSVN_API_Packages.jpg"></img>-->

<P>
<b>JavaSVN</b><SUP>TM</SUP> is a powerful pure Java Subversion (SVN) client library. This means that users of the library, i.e. java applications 
do not have to include SVN native binaries or <i>javahl</i> bindings to work with a Subversion repository.
<P>
The library represents two main concepts for developers who use a Subversion repository in their projects:
<ul>
<li>Low-level API  - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.io</b> - a solution for those developers who doesn't need to work with the native
Subversion high-level format known as <i>'Working Copy'</i> - that is when all local files are stored in a filesystem and all version controll 
metadata is concentrated in <i>.svn</i> directories. For instance, those developers who would like to customize managing versioned files - like
storing and managing versioned data as well as all metadata within a data base -
will certainly find this package pretty suitable for their purposes.       
</ul>
<ul>
<li>High-level API - the package <b>org.tmatesoft.svn.core.wc</b> - this is a set of classes and interfaces designed to provide developers means
for working particularly with the native Subversion format - <i>'Working Copy'</i>. All the commands supported by the SVN command line client can be 
also easily performed by using this high-level API. Obviously in those cases when an operation needs an access to a repository this high-level API 
uses the low-level one.
</ul>
